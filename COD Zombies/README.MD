# For map makers
To make a buyable door in your map, name any door following the format **zombies_door\<id\>_\<price\>** where **\<id\>** is any number and **\<price\>** is the cost to open the door.

The door should start locked. Door names must be unique. That is, 2 unlockable doors must not have the exact same name. The mutation will input Unlock then Open to the door when a player buys it.
